<strong><u>Module 6A – Pseudocode Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must write the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  The Pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed at <a href="https://kennesawedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/dtatum7_kennesaw_edu/Documents/9.%20Capstone%20project%20final%20acceptance%20and%20assessment%20Hackthon%20Registration%20-%20Dawn%20Tatum.docx?web=1">http://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/Pseudocode.php</a>







<strong><u>Problem Statement</u></strong>:




Write a program that reads every line in a text file, line by line. Obtain the name of the existing file and the name of the new (copy) of the file by prompting the user for both of these on the console.  Make sure that the original file exists and can be read.  If not, display a warning message and allow the user to either abort the program or enter a new file name.  If the name of the new file to copy the text into already exists, then display a warning message and ask the user if they wish to overwrite the existing file or change the file name.  If they wish to give a new name, then go through the same procedure as you did with the first name.




After you have copied the file successfully, you should display to the user the name of the original file that was copied and the name of the file it was copied to successfully.




(A sample file “textfile.txt” has been included along with this assignment in the dropbox to assist you in your programming)




<strong><u>Break the problem down and write the pseudocode: </u></strong>

Break the problem statement into parts to fully understand what is expected as input, output and processes in your code.  Write down all the variables you will need from the problem statement.  Once you have broken down the problem, start writing your pseudocode.




Writing the pseudocode may take a while and several iterations to fully get the solution complete.  Walk through the problem and your pseudocode as if the program is running.




Now make sure that your pseudocode is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your pseudocode
